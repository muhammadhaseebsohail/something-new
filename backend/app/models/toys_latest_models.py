In your provided code, the Pydantic models for request and response are already defined. The ToyBase is the base request model for creating a new toy and Toy is the response model which includes the id and created_at fields.

However, if you would like to add a search DTO, it could be done as follows:

```python
class ToySearch(BaseModel):
    q: str
```

This model could be used as a request model for the search endpoint, but it's not strictly necessary since FastAPI will automatically convert query parameters to function arguments as needed.

For example:

```python
@app.get("/toys/search", response_model=List[Toy])
async def search_toys(toy_search: ToySearch, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    """Search for toys based on a query string."""
    toys = db.query(Toy).filter(Toy.name.contains(toy_search.q)).all()
    return toys
```

However, it's often simpler to use query parameters directly as you've done in your original code. In this case, the query parameter `q` serves as the "request model" for the search endpoint.

The response model for both endpoints is List[Toy], which is a list of Toy objects. This model includes the id, name, description, and created_at fields for each toy in the database. 

Regarding DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), they are typically used to map domain models to API models. In this case, Pydantic models are already serving as DTOs.

Remember that if you plan to use DTOs in a larger application, it might be helpful to create separate DTOs for request and response models to keep your API flexible and maintainable. For example, you might want to include additional fields in the response model that are not present in the request model, such as timestamps or other server-generated values.
