### 1. Test Objectives

The main objective of this testing task is to ensure that the login page of the application works as intended. The testing will include:

- Input validation
- Successful login
- Failed login
- 'Forgot password' and 'Create account' links

### 2. Test Scope

The scope of the testing includes the login page of the application. Specifically, the input validation of the login form, successful and failed login attempts, and the functionality of the 'Forgot password' and 'Create account' links.

### 3. Test Cases with Expected Results

1. **Test Case:** Enter valid username and password
   **Expected Result:** Successful login, should redirect to the homepage.

2. **Test Case:** Enter invalid username or password
   **Expected Result:** Show an error message, "Invalid username or password."

3. **Test Case:** Leave username or password fields empty
   **Expected Result:** Show an error message, "Fields cannot be empty."

4. **Test Case:** Enter a username with special characters
   **Expected Result:** Show an error message, "Username cannot have special characters."

5. **Test Case:** Click on 'Forgot password' link
   **Expected Result:** Should redirect to the 'Forgot password' page.

6. **Test Case:** Click on 'Create account' link
   **Expected Result:** Should redirect to the 'Create account' page.

### 4. Test Data Requirements

The test data required for this task includes:

- Valid usernames and passwords
- Invalid usernames and passwords
- Empty fields
- Usernames with special characters

### 5. Test Environment Setup

The testing will be conducted on the staging environment which mirrors the production environment. The staging environment should have the same data as the production environment for accurate testing results. The necessary frameworks/tools for testing such as Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, pytest, etc. should be properly installed and configured.

### 6. Acceptance Criteria

The login page will be considered to have passed the tests if it fulfills the following criteria:

- The input validation works correctly and gives appropriate error messages.
- The page successfully allows a user with valid credentials to log in.
- The page correctly denies access and shows an error message when invalid credentials are entered.
- The 'Forgot password' and 'Create account' links redirect to the appropriate pages.
- The test coverage for the login page should be above 90%.
- All the test cases should pass without any errors.

This testing task will ensure that the login functionality of the application is working as expected and provides a smooth user experience.
