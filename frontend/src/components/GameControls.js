Here's a simple version of a GameControls component. Note, this component uses `useEffect` to add the keyboard event listeners when the component mounts, and remove them when it unmounts. It also uses `React.TouchEvent` and `React.KeyboardEvent` for touch and keyboard events respectively. 

1. Component Code:
```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

/**
 * GameControls component - handles keyboard and touch controls
 */
function GameControls({ onKeyPress, onTouch }) {

  // Add event listeners for keyboard and touch controls
  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('keydown', onKeyPress);
    window.addEventListener('touchstart', onTouch);
    
    // Cleanup function to remove event listeners
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('keydown', onKeyPress);
      window.removeEventListener('touchstart', onTouch);
    }
  }, [onKeyPress, onTouch]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Use keyboard or touch controls to play the game.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

GameControls.propTypes = {
  onKeyPress: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  onTouch: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
};

export default GameControls;
```

2. CSS/Styling:
For this component, styling would be minimal as it's mainly responsible for functionality. However, you can always add CSS based on your UI design.

3. PropTypes:
```jsx
GameControls.propTypes = {
  onKeyPress: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  onTouch: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
};
```

4. Basic Unit Test Setup:
```jsx
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import GameControls from './GameControls';

test('check if keyboard and touch events are triggered correctly', () => {
  const handleKeyPress = jest.fn();
  const handleTouch = jest.fn();

  render(<GameControls onKeyPress={handleKeyPress} onTouch={handleTouch} />);

  fireEvent.keyDown(window, { key: 'ArrowRight' });
  expect(handleKeyPress).toHaveBeenCalled();

  fireEvent.touchStart(window);
  expect(handleTouch).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```
Please note: The actual implementation of the game controls would depend heavily on the specifics of the game, such as the controls that are required, the actions that need to be performed in response to those controls, etc. This is a very basic implementation that can be used as a starting point and expanded upon based on the needs of the game.
