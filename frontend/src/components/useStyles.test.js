The given test checks if the home page renders without crashing and if the text "Toy Store" is present in the document. 

However, to thoroughly test the Home component we should also test other component behaviors such as: 

1. The loading state is displayed when the data is being fetched.
2. The error state is displayed when there's a problem fetching the data.
3. The toy data is displayed when it's fetched successfully.

Here's how you can set up these tests:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import axios from 'axios'
import { render, waitForElementToBeRemoved } from '@testing-library/react'
import Home from './Home'

jest.mock('axios')

test('renders loading state initially', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<Home apiUrl="http://example.com/api/toys" />)
  expect(getByText(/Loading.../i)).toBeInTheDocument()
})

test('renders error state when there is a problem fetching data', async () => {
  axios.get.mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error('API error'))
  const { getByText } = render(<Home apiUrl="http://example.com/api/toys" />)
  await waitForElementToBeRemoved(() => getByText(/Loading.../i))
  expect(getByText(/Error: API error/i)).toBeInTheDocument()
})

test('renders toy data when it is fetched successfully', async () => {
  const toyData = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Toy 1', image: 'image1.png', description: 'This is Toy 1' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Toy 2', image: 'image2.png', description: 'This is Toy 2' },
  ]
  axios.get.mockResolvedValueOnce({ data: toyData })
  const { getByText } = render(<Home apiUrl="http://example.com/api/toys" />)
  await waitForElementToBeRemoved(() => getByText(/Loading.../i))
  expect(getByText(/Toy 1/i)).toBeInTheDocument()
  expect(getByText(/Toy 2/i)).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

In the above tests, we're using `jest.mock('axios')` to mock axios and control its behavior. This allows us to simulate different responses from the API (successful response, error response) and test how our component reacts to these. 

Also, `waitForElementToBeRemoved` is used to wait for the loading state to disappear before making assertions. This is necessary because our component fetches data asynchronously.
