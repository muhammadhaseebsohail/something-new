Frontend Tests:

Test Case 1: Test empty input validation
  - Use Jest and React Testing Library
  - Expected result: Show error message "Username/Password field is required"

Test Case 2: Test invalid input validation
  - Use Jest and React Testing Library
  - Expected result: Show error message "Invalid username/Password"

Test Case 3: Test successful login
  - Use Jest and React Testing Library
  - Expected result: Redirect user to the homepage/dashboard and save user session

Test Case 4: Test failed login
  - Use Jest and React Testing Library
  - Expected result: Show error message "Invalid credentials"

Test Case 5: Test 'Forgot password' link
  - Use Jest and React Testing Library
  - Expected result: Redirect user to the 'Reset Password' page

Test Case 6: Test 'Create account' link
  - Use Jest and React Testing Library
  - Expected result: Redirect user to the 'Register' page

End-to-end Tests:

Test Case 7: Test full login flow
  - Use Cypress or Playwright
  - Expected result: User is able to login and is redirected to the homepage/dashboard

Backend Tests:

Test Case 8: Test API login endpoint
  - Use pytest for Python/FastAPI tests
  - Expected result: Successful API response with user data and token

Test Case 9: Test API login endpoint with invalid credentials
  - Use pytest for Python/FastAPI tests
  - Expected result: Error response with message "Invalid credentials"

Performance Tests:

Test Case 10: Test login page load time
  - Use Lighthouse or similar tool
  - Expected result: Page load time should be within acceptable range

Test Case 11: Test API response time for login endpoint
  - Use pytest for Python/FastAPI tests
  - Expected result: API response time should be within acceptable range

These tests cover the basic functionality of a login page, including input validation, successful and unsuccessful login attempts, navigating to other pages, and performance. They also adhere to best practices for test organization, ensuring that each type of test (unit, integration, E2E, and performance) is clearly identified and separated.
